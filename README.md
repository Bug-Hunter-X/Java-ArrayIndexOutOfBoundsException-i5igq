# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug
This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The bug occurs when trying to access an array element using an index that is out of the valid range (0 to array.length - 1).

The `Bug.java` file contains the buggy code. The `BugSolution.java` file shows how to fix it.

This is a simple example to help illustrate a frequent source of errors in Java programming.  Always check array bounds before accessing elements to prevent unexpected exceptions.
